Output Parsing
MGA - will be called whatever is put in the 'open("{}", "w")' area
gene_# start stop ignore rest

FGS - will be called '-out={}'.gff -> will need to generate a gene#
accession skip skip start stop 

Glimmer - will be called whatever is in the last parameter .predict
orf# start stop

Prodigal
obnoxious but can reuse the previous code

prediction# - just automake start - group1 stop - group2
